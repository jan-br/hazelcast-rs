## Hazelcast Rust Client library
This is a very early, unfinished and incomplete library for the Hazelcast in-memory data grid. It is not yet ready for production use.
It is modelled after the official [Node.JS Hazelcast library](https://hazelcast.com/clients/node-js/).

Code generation of the codecs is handled in a fork of the [Hazelcast Client Protocol project](https://github.com/jan-br/hazelcast-client-protocol-rs)
